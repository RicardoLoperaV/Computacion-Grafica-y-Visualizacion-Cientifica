abstract = {Immersive visualization utilizes virtual reality, mixed reality devices, and other interactive devices to create a novel visual environment that integrates multimodal perception and interaction. This technology has been maturing in recent years and has found broad applications in various fields. Based on the latest research advancements in visualization, this paper summarizes the state-of-the-art work in immersive visualization from the perspectives of multimodal perception and interaction in immersive environments, additionally discusses the current hardware foundations of immersive setups. By examining the design patterns and research approaches of previous immersive methods, the paper reveals the design factors for multimodal perception and interaction in current immersive environments. Furthermore, the challenges and development trends of immersive multimodal perception and interaction techniques are discussed, and potential areas of growth in immersive visualization design directions are explored.}
